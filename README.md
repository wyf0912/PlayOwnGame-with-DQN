# PlayOwnGame-with-DQN
	This project is to train a GAME AI.
	For the convenience of training AI, I write a simple game which can accommodate two players. So I can train the AI by computer against each other. And limited to my time and ability, the game is made very rough. But if the AI model trained well, maybe the confrontation process is also wondeful.
