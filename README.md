# PlayOwnGame-with-DQN
# This project is to train a GAME AI.<br>
For the convenience of training AI, I write a simple game which can accommodate two players.<br>
So I can train the AI by computer against each other. And limited to my time and ability, the game is made very rough.<br> 
But if the AI model trained well, maybe the confrontation process is also wondeful.<br>

And this is the UI of the game.<br>

>The two boards can be a player or a computer.<br>
 And the boad can move in four directions.<br>
 Getting the ball and making the other player fail to receive will scor.<br>
 And failing to reveive the ball will dock points.<br>
 When a certain difference of score is reached, one of the players win.<br>
